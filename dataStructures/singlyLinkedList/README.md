## JavaScript implementation of singly linked list

**Singly linked list** is a linear collection of data elements. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. It can be used to implement several other common abstract data types, including *lists, stacks, queues.* 

`Each node contains: data, and a reference to the next node in the sequence.`

#### advantages
- linked list is dynamic, so the length of list can increase or decrease as necessary
- each node does not necessarily follow the previous one physically in the memory
- elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure
- insertion and removal of nodes is allowed at any point in the list

#### disadvantages
- access time is linear (sequential access)
- random acces is not feasible
- more memory usage than arrays because of the storage used by pointers
